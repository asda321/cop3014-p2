// Important announcement on Significance of Academic Honor Policy
// The  Academic Honor Policy is an important aspect of keeping the integrity
// and quality of the computer science courses in general. Please don't share
// your project source with any other students on any occasion. I would like
// to let you know that, for the summer 2018 COP3014 course, we found several
// students violated the Academic Honor Policy by sharing their programming
// assignment source in an advertent and inadvertent manners. Please note that
// we will run MOSS" (plagiarism detection software tool) on future COP3014 student
// project submissions together with your summer 2018 project" submissions.
// In case your project source code happens to be >%75" similar to future student
// project source (which is statistically" almost impossible), your grade will
// be invalidated and your academic honor code violation will be reported to Dean's
// office. The following is the quick reference for Academic Honor Policy:"
